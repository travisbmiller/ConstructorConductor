//Just like you can add methods to your own constructor, you can also add methods and properties
//to built in classes in JavaScript like Arrays and Objects.

//Add a reverse method to the String 'class' so that every instance of String can call reverse
//and reverse itself.

  String.prototype.reverse = function() {
    var reverse = this.split('').reverse().join('');
